# Tiq-Taq-Toq

Tiq-Taq-Toq is a quantum-inspired version of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe, implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface and Qiskit to handle quantum operations. This game allows players to experience two different modes: Superposition Mode and Entanglement Mode, offering a unique twist on the traditional gameplay.

## Features

- **Quantum Modes:** Play Tic-Tac-Toe with quantum effects:
  - **Entanglement Mode (Fare):** Moves are based on quantum entanglement principles.
  - **Superposition Mode (Unfare):** Utilizes the concept of superposition to influence the board.
- **Graphical User Interface:** Fully interactive GUI built with Tkinter.
- **Quantum Circuit Simulation:** Quantum operations are simulated using Qiskit, providing an authentic quantum experience.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run Tiq-Taq-Toq, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `qiskit`
- `tkinter` (usually comes with Python)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy qiskit qiskit_aer
